# Task: Clarify documentation language policy

## Description
The `AGENTS.MD` states that all documentation is maintained in English, but the repository contains Russian files such as `README_RU.MD`, `CV_RU.MD` and `DOCS/ru/`. Update the guidelines to explicitly mention allowed localized documents or translate remaining Russian files to English.
