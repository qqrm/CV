# Alexey Belyakov

## Summary
Hands-on engineering leader. I scale Rust-first platforms and keep migrations predictable for teams and executives. I balance delivery speed, budgets, and people growth. I align product, SRE, and compliance.

## Impact Highlights
- Release frequency doubled. p95 lead time down ~25%. Change-fail rate down ~30%.
- MTTR down ~35%. Incident backlog down ~30%.
- Supply chain security: zero critical vulns. Faster audit prep with SBOM and policy.
- Hiring engine: time-to-hire −20%, onboarding −30%, 6-month retention ~95%.
