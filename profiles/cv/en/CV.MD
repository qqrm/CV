## Summary
Engineering leader with 15+ years in software and about five years in leadership, focused on regulated and high-trust product delivery. I build cross-functional backend, DevOps, and QA teams, align architecture and release governance, and keep reliability, security, and compliance expectations met.

## Experience

### Engineering Manager • [Inline Group](https://www.inlinegroup.ru/)
*March 2023 - Present*

Led backend, DevOps, and QA delivery for migrating an Oracle/SAP-based procurement platform from monolith to Rust microservices.

- Led a team scope of about 25-30 people, with about 12 direct backend reports; DevOps and QA were managed via team leads, and frontend work was coordinated through APIs.
- Delivered about 20 services across domain and platform utilities such as logging, email, and shared components.
- Designed per-service databases with PostgreSQL, Redis caching, RabbitMQ async integration, and forward-only schema migrations.
- Built GitLab CI/CD with GitOps, reproducible builds, release tagging, and rollback practices; supported daily deployments across dev, stage, and release stands.
- Expanded QA automation and API regression coverage; reduced the test pipeline from about 30 minutes to about 5-7 minutes via parallelization and test isolation.
- Implemented compliance-ready delivery with regulated Linux distributions, a private artifact registry with pinned approvals, dependency scanning (cargo-audit) as a CI gate, and customer security reviews.
- Defined SLI/SLO targets, MTTR tracking, and error-budget practices when services stabilized, prioritizing delivery reliability and security.

**Stack:** Rust, Actix Web, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, GitLab CI/CD, Odoo, Grafana, Sentry, Swagger, Telegram Bot API, Mattermost, Clippy, cargo-audit, SonarQube.

### Lead Rust Engineer • [YADRO](https://yadro.com/)
*February 2022 - March 2023*

Backup appliance with deduplication.

- Led delivery of core product components and owned key architecture decisions for storage and restore.
- Established team engineering practices: planning, reviews, quality standards, CI/CD, and automated testing to improve release predictability.
- Mentored engineers and supported Rust adoption for former C++ developers through training and guidelines.
- Owned performance and reliability outcomes: RocksDB and storage tuning, performance testing, incident analysis and root cause fixes.
- Improved operational readiness via metrics, alerting, and clear documentation and runbooks.

### Software Engineer • [Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com/)
*May 2020 - February 2022*

Supported and extended a production blockchain voting service on Exonum, prioritizing improvements from user feedback. Added weight-based voting, streamlined ballot flows, and raised unit and integration test coverage. Simplified pipelines during a migration to Microsoft tooling and led refactors to keep the stack current.

**Stack:** Rust, Exonum, Protobuf, Serde, Git.

### Software Engineer • [B2Broker](https://b2broker.com/)
*November 2018 - March 2020*

Built brokerage automation on MT4 and MT5 APIs. Delivered trade copiers in C++ and Go and a Multi Account Manager. Designed services to normalize and stream trading data with real-time guarantees. Built data collectors for statistical analysis.

**Stack:** MSVC, CMake, Protobuf, gRPC, NATS, YAML, PostgreSQL, Vcpkg, Git.

### C++ Engineer • [ASCON](https://ascon.ru)
*May 2016 - November 2018*

Developed CAD libraries for KOMPAS. Built a Change View Plane feature for 3D workflows. Introduced an automated C++ and Python testing framework that reduced manual QA work. Led a refactor to C++17. Moved the organization from SVN to Git. Set up Scrum and documentation standards.

**Stack:** MSVC, C++17, Python 3, Boost, PostgreSQL, Git, Jenkins.

### Earlier Roles
- C++ Developer at Concerteza: real-time protocol parsing for telecom signaling analytics up to about 1.5 Gbps per single thread, CPU and memory optimization, stable processing of continuous event streams, Python-based integration tests.
- C++ & JavaScript Developer at LiveTex: Node.js bindings for PostgreSQL and ZeroMQ.
- Junior C++ Developer at T4B: MetaTrader plugins and a management web app.

## Leadership System
- Weekly portfolio reviews on KPI, SLI/SLO health, release risk, and budget.
- Quarterly planning across product, engineering, ops, and compliance.
- Continuous improvement via retrospectives, surveys, incident reviews, and small experiments.
- Release readiness and reporting through Jira dashboards, Confluence scorecards, and concise memos.
