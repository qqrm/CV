## Work Experience

### Engineering Manager @ Inline Group | March 2023 – Present
*March 2023 – Present*

**Leadership & Delivery**
- Lead a 25-person program replacing SAP workflows with a Rust microservices stack while keeping quarterly goals intact.
- Coordinate backend, QA, analytics, and DevOps leads so roadmap and budget decisions stay transparent.
- Introduced async and personal sprint planning that lifted productivity by ~15% and predictability by ~25%.
- Ran a lightweight release board that aligned QA sign-offs, SAST policies, and deployment readiness checks.

**Tech Stack & Tooling**
- Rust (Tokio, Actix Web, Axum, tonic) with supporting Go, Python, and TypeScript services.
- PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Redis, Kafka, and NATS for data movement and storage.
- Kubernetes on AWS, GCP, and Azure with Terraform, Argo CD, and GitOps automation.
- GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, SonarQube, Snyk, and Prometheus/Grafana for delivery and reliability guardrails.

**People & Governance**
- Grew the backend team from 5 to 12 engineers while trimming onboarding time by ~30%.
- Retained 90% of hires after the first year with growth plans and recurring feedback.
- Mentored three engineers into senior roles and rolled out static analysis and internal package delivery to meet compliance goals.

### Rust Team Lead @ Solcery | March 2022 – March 2023
- Managed a 4-person Rust team building a blockchain-ready database on Solana.
- Turned product goals into sprint plans, release scopes, and clear specs.
