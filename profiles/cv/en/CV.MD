# Alexey Belyakov

## Summary
Engineering leader who works directly with teams. I grow Rust platforms and plan migrations so they stay predictable for teammates and stakeholders. I balance delivery speed, budget, and people growth. I help product, SRE, and compliance work as one group.

## Impact Highlights
- Doubled release frequency and cut p95 lead time by about 25%. Change-fail rate dropped by roughly 30%.
- Reduced MTTR by about 35% and incident backlog by about 30%.
- Kept supply chain security clean with zero critical vulnerabilities and faster audit prep through SBOM and policy work.
- Built a steady hiring flow: time-to-hire down 20%, onboarding time down 30%, six-month retention around 95%.
