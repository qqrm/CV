## Executive Summary
Engineering Manager with 10+ years in backend and platform. Led 10-20 engineers across Rust microservices, observability, and secure supply chain. Drove SAP-to-Rust modernization, raised delivery throughput, and hardened reliability with SLO discipline. Comfortable with budgets, hiring pipelines, and cross-functional delivery at enterprise scale.

## Core Skills
- People leadership: org design, hiring bar, performance cycles, coaching, delivery governance, roadmap ownership, budget, vendor management, stakeholder comms, program management.
- Technical leadership: Rust services, async I/O, Postgres, Kafka, Redis, gRPC, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, IaC, SAST and SBOM, cost control, tracing and SLOs, incident response and MTTR.

## Impact Highlights
- Modernization program: cut p95 lead time to production by 25-30 percent, doubled release frequency, reduced change-fail rate by 30 percent. Team 12 FTE, multi-vendor setup. Business effect: faster feature revenue capture and lower rework.
- Reliability: SLOs and incident reviews moved MTTR down by 35 percent and ticket backlog down by 30 percent. Quarterly roadmap hit rate 85-90 percent.
- Secure supply chain: private crate registry, dependency policy, SBOM in CI, critical vulnerabilities down to zero, audit time per release down by 50 percent.
- Hiring engine: time-to-hire −20 percent, time-to-productivity −30 percent, retention at 6 months 95 percent. Built senior Rust bench and succession plans.
