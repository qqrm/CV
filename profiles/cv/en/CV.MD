## Executive Summary
Hands-on engineering leader who scales Rust-centric platforms and keeps migrations predictable for executives and teams. Balances delivery cadence, budget guardrails, and people development while aligning product, SRE, and compliance stakeholders.

## Core Strengths
- Roadmap ownership across multi-team programs, risk surfacing, and transparent stakeholder updates.
- KPI/OKR design with automated dashboards that expose delivery, quality, and budget signals.
- Governance that blends DevOps practices, secure supply chain controls, and release readiness gates.
- Hiring loops, mentoring frameworks, and growth plans that retain senior talent and successors.

## Impact Highlights
- SAP-to-Rust modernization: doubled release frequency, trimmed p95 lead time by ~25%, and cut change-fail rate by ~30%.
- Reliability uplift: incident postmortems and SLO dashboards reduced MTTR by ~35% and backlog by ~30%.
- Secure delivery: internal crate registry, dependency policy, and SBOM automation dropped critical vulns to zero and halved audit prep.
- Hiring engine: time-to-hire −20%, onboarding −30%, and 6-month retention at ~95% while scaling leadership bench.
