## Profile
Rust tech lead with deep experience in microservices, blockchain platforms, and performance-critical storage. Balances architectural design with hands-on coding, guiding teams through complex migrations, reliability improvements, and system hardening.

## Technical Focus
- Microservice and event-driven architectures with on-prem and hybrid deployments.
- Storage engines, data modeling, and schema migrations for blockchain and fintech workloads.
- Performance profiling, benchmarking, and low-level optimizations in Rust.
- Secure software supply chains, internal registries, and static analysis integration.
- CI/CD automation, reproducible builds, and observability-driven operations.

## Work Experience

### Tech Lead (microservices) @ Inline Group | March 2023 – Present
- Architected a Rust-based replacement for SAP workflows, covering dozens of services and integrations.
- Introduced async planning, service ownership, and cross-team architecture reviews to manage rapid scope growth.
- Implemented internal package distribution and security scanning to satisfy enterprise compliance.
- Coordinated performance tuning, load testing, and release readiness across backend, QA, and DevOps teams.

### Lead Rust Developer @ YADRO | March 2023 – March 2024
- Improved architecture of deduplication-based backup systems handling petabyte-scale datasets.
- Researched RocksDB tuning, NVMe optimizations, and compression strategies to meet latency SLAs.
- Mentored engineers moving from C++ to Rust, standardizing patterns for async IO and memory safety.

### Rust Team Lead @ Solcery | March 2022 – March 2023
- Designed blockchain storage primitives, versioning strategies, and migration tooling on Solana.
- Built DAO-ready data flows with deterministic execution and secure smart contract interactions.
- Reduced review cycle time by ~40% through linting, CI automation, and pair design sessions.

### Senior Rust Developer @ Kaspersky Lab | May 2021 – March 2022
- Maintained a blockchain voting service, expanding test coverage to ~75% and tightening CI pipelines.
- Drove refactors to simplify feature rollout, reduce production incidents, and document critical paths.

## Systems & Performance Highlights
- Delivered SAP migration services that stayed within 5% of budget while throughput and latency targets improved.
- Cut bug backlog by ~30% via systematic performance testing, fault injection, and QA collaboration.
- Established telemetry dashboards (Grafana, Prometheus) that exposed bottlenecks early and accelerated tuning.

## Architecture Practices
- Architecture decision records, readiness checklists, and design reviews with actionable follow-up.
- Threat modeling, dependency audits, and supply-chain controls (Clippy, cargo-audit, SAST) baked into CI/CD.
- Chaos and load testing playbooks that validate failover and capacity before production launches.

## Tools & Stack
- Rust, Actix Web, Tokio, Axum, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka.
- RocksDB, NVMe, Protocol Buffers, gRPC, GraphQL.
- GitLab CI/CD, Terraform, Ansible, Grafana, Prometheus, Loki.
- Profiling: `perf`, `flamegraph`, `cargo-instruments`, `criterion`.
