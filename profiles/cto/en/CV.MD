## Experience

### Head of Development • [Inline Group](https://www.inlinegroup.ru/)
*February 2023 — Present*

Lead the technology direction of a corporate platform in procurement and internal process domains for a major oil-and-gas enterprise.

**Operating model and scope:**
- Team size: 40–45 engineers.
- Cross-functional backend, DevOps, and QA teams led through team leads and a unified release process.
- Cross-team coordination via API contracts, release synchronization, and quality gates.

**Responsibilities:**
- Product-technology governance: goals, roadmap, KPIs, execution control, and risk management.
- Capacity and staffing management: workload planning, stream allocation, and feature/tech-debt balance.
- End-to-end ownership of development, rollout, and platform operations.
- Ownership of platform services around the product: shared components, integrations, internal communication services.
- Operations as a product: monitoring, alerting, on-call/incident process, postmortems, and SRE practices.
- Engineering excellence for speed and quality: release discipline, automated testing, transparent metrics.

**Key results:**
- Led monolith-to-services transformation and delivered around 20 services across domain and platform layers.
- Built a release framework with reproducible builds, release tags, rollback practices, and daily delivery to dev/stage/prod.
- Reduced API regression cycle time from ~30 minutes to 5–7 minutes through parallelization and test isolation.
- Introduced observability and incident lifecycle: reliability/recovery metrics, RCA, and data-driven improvements.
- Ensured secure and governable delivery: dependency policy, CI checks, successful platform go-live under FSTEC-aligned infrastructure requirements.
- Reduced production defect rate to 1–2 defects per quarter after service stabilization.
- Cut time from task to production by ~50% through process standardization, predictable planning, and focused staffing.
- Introduced AI tooling into the engineering workflow: rules, templates for tasks/reviews, team enablement, and quality control.
- Established a unified service catalog and clear team ownership, reducing responsibility gaps and bus factor.

**Stack:** Rust, Actix Web, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Docker, GitLab CI/CD, GitOps, Grafana, Sentry, Swagger/OpenAPI, SonarQube, cargo audit, Kubernetes.
