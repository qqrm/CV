## Experience

### Head of Development • [Inline Group](https://www.inlinegroup.ru/)
*February 2023 — Present*

I lead the technology direction of a corporate platform in procurement and internal process domains for a leading oil-and-gas enterprise. I own technology strategy, architecture, change delivery, quality, and operations.

**Operating model and scope:**
- Program team of 40–45 people.
- Cross-functional backend, DevOps, and QA teams managed through team leads and a unified release flow.
- Cross-team coordination via API contracts, joint planning, release synchronization, and quality gates.

**CTO-level responsibilities:**
- Product-technology governance: align requirements with product owners, convert goals into roadmaps and KPIs, control execution and risk.
- Capacity and staffing management: allocate people across streams and balance features vs. technical debt.
- Full lifecycle ownership: development, rollout, and platform operations.
- Ownership of platform services around the product: shared components, integrations, communication and internal interaction services.
- Operations as a product: observability, alerting, on-call, incident process, postmortems, data-driven improvements, and SRE practices.
- Engineering practices for speed and quality: release discipline, test automation, and transparent metrics.

**Key outcomes:**
- Led monolith-to-services transformation and delivered around 20 services across domain and platform layers.
- Built a release framework with reproducible builds, release tags, rollback practices, and daily deliveries to dev/stage/prod.
- Expanded QA automation and API regression, reducing test cycle time from ~30 minutes to 5–7 minutes.
- Introduced operations practices: observability, incident lifecycle, reliability/recovery metrics, and root-cause analysis.
- Ensured secure and governable delivery: controlled artifact pipeline, dependency policy, CI checks, successful security verification for the new platform go-live under infrastructure requirements aligned with FSTEC expectations.
- Reduced production defects to 1–2 per quarter after service stabilization.
- Reduced task-to-release lead time by ~50% through process standardization, predictable planning, and targeted staffing.
- Introduced AI tooling into engineering workflow: rules and constraints, templates for tasks/reviews, team enablement, and quality control.
- Established a unified service catalog and team ownership model, reducing gray zones and bus factor.

**Stack:** Rust, Actix Web, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Docker, GitLab CI/CD, GitOps, Grafana, Sentry, Swagger, SonarQube, cargo audit, Kubernetes.
