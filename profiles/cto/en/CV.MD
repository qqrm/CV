# Alexey Belyakov

## Summary
Technical leader, team lead, and engineering manager with 15+ years in software engineering and around 5 years in people and delivery management. Core focus: backend, platform architecture, reliability, and operations. Led cross-functional backend, DevOps, and QA teams; built roadmaps; managed technical debt; established release discipline and engineering standards. Delivered controlled monolith-to-service transformation, implemented CI/CD and test automation, and treated quality as a repeatable system rather than one-off effort. Worked in high-trust and regulated environments, passed security reviews, and built governed delivery processes.

A separate strength is practical AI adoption in engineering. I use a contextual programming approach: specifications, standards, and verifiable acceptance criteria; I automate workflows, measure outcomes, and maintain quality.


## Experience

### Head of Development • [Inline Group](https://www.inlinegroup.ru/)
*February 2023 — Present*

I lead the technology direction of a corporate platform in procurement and internal-process domains for a leading oil-and-gas company. End-to-end ownership of technology strategy, architecture, delivery, quality, and operations. Focus: controlled monolith-to-services transformation without stopping product development and without reliability degradation.

**Operating model and scope:**
- Program team of 40-45 people.
- Cross-functional backend, DevOps, and QA teams managed via team leads and a unified release flow.
- Cross-team alignment through API contracts, joint planning, release synchronization, and shared quality criteria.

**Director-level responsibilities:**
- Product-technology governance: align requirements with product owners, convert goals into roadmaps and KPIs, control execution and risks.
- Resource and capacity management: workload planning, staffing across streams, balancing feature delivery and technical debt.
- Full lifecycle ownership of development, rollout, and operations: from concept and architecture to support and continuous improvement.
- Ownership of platform service domain around the product: shared components, integrations, communication and internal interaction services.
- Operations as a product: monitoring and alerting requirements, on-call setup, incident process, postmortems, data-driven improvements, SRE practices.
- Engineering speed-and-quality practices: release discipline, test automation, transparent metrics.

**Key outcomes:**
- Completed monolith-to-service transformation and delivered about 20 services across domain and platform layers.
- Built a release framework: reproducible builds, release tags, rollback practices, daily deliveries to dev, stage, and prod environments.
- Expanded QA automation and API regression, reducing test cycle time from about 30 minutes to 5-7 minutes via parallelization and test isolation.
- Introduced operational practices: observability, incident lifecycle, reliability and recovery metrics, root-cause analysis, and data-driven prioritization.
- Ensured security and governed delivery requirements: controlled artifact pipeline, dependency policy, CI checks, successful security reviews for new-platform commissioning, with infrastructure controls aligned with FSTEC requirements.
- Reduced production time-to-delivery through release discipline, automation, and standardized delivery pipelines.
- Reduced production defect rate to 1-2 defects per quarter and lowered incident frequency after service stabilization; institutionalized RCA and preventive improvements through CI/CD quality controls and architecture reviews.
- Reduced task-to-release lead time by 50% through process standardization, predictable planning, and reinforcement with key specialists.
- Introduced AI tooling into engineering workflow: rules and constraints, templates for tasks and reviews, team enablement, quality controls.
- Established a unified service catalog and team ownership model, removed responsibility gray zones, and reduced bus factor.

**Communication and user collaboration:**
- Developed technical capabilities for transactional communication flows within the platform and aligned delivery-reliability, observability, and integration-SLA requirements.

**Stack:** Rust, Actix Web, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Docker, GitLab CI/CD, GitOps, Grafana, Sentry, Swagger, SonarQube, cargo audit, Kubernetes.
