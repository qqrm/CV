## Executive Focus
- Strategic planning and roadmap ownership across multi-team initiatives.
- Stakeholder engagement, executive communication, and cross-functional alignment.
- Budget and P&L oversight, resource allocation, and risk mitigation.
- KPI/OKR tracking with transparent reporting and data-driven decisions.
- DevOps strategy, release governance, and automation-first delivery practices.

## Signature Achievements
- Built the end-to-end engineering platform: unified CI/CD, mandatory quality gates, staging environments, and centralized observability.
- Assembled and embedded the DevOps team with clear roles and accountability inside the delivery stream.
- Owned the full people-management cycle: hiring, interviews, onboarding, regular one-to-ones, performance reviews, growth plans, and offboarding.
- Stabilized development processesâ€”planning, Scrum ceremonies, code reviews, release calendar, and quality control.
- Made quality automation non-negotiable: static analysis, SAST, linters, and gated CI/CD test stages.
- Deployed observability and incident response tooling, including centralized logging, alerting, an on-call rotation, and runbooks.
- Participated in architecture sessions to stress-test designs for scalability and resilience.
- Estimated effort and budgets for post-launch enhancements to plan follow-up releases.
- Kept releases on schedule by managing risks, removing blockers, and synchronizing cross-functional teams.

## Delivery Leadership
- Coordinated backend, QA, and DevOps streams to keep shared milestones on track.
- Oversaw roadmap planning and capacity balancing while maintaining ~90% KPI adherence.
- Introduced Agile cadences, retrospectives, and code review policies that increased development velocity by ~20%.
- Chaired a release board aligning QA sign-offs, SAST gates, and rollout readiness to avoid schedule slips.

## Operating Rhythm
- Established performance reviews, mentoring frameworks, and growth plans for every engineer.
- Partnered with Product to balance scope with migration budgets and quarter goals.
- Launched OKR tracking and Jira dashboards for real-time visibility into objectives.

## Outcomes
- Delivery stayed within 5% of budget while expanding the team from 5 to 12 developers in six months.
- Sprint predictability improved by ~25% through structured backlog refinement and retrospectives.
- Bug backlog shrank by ~30% after strengthening QA and review processes and tightening governance.
- Release predictability increased thanks to automated quality gates, feature toggles, and shared runbooks.
