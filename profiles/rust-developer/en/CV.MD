# Alexey Belyakov

## Summary
Rust software engineer with 13+ years in backend and platform engineering. I design and ship reliable services for high-load, high-trust domains: API contracts, integrations, resilience, production operations, and predictable releases. A strong side is applying AI in development through specs, engineering standards, verifiable acceptance criteria, and measurable automation.

## Experience

### Rust Software Engineer • [Inline Group](https://www.inlinegroup.ru/)
*February 2023 — Present*

Corporate platform for procurement and internal business processes.

- Build backend services in Rust (Actix Web): REST APIs, domain logic, and business rules.
- Maintain API contracts (OpenAPI/Swagger) and backward compatibility for adjacent-system integrations.
- Design PostgreSQL schemas and queries; use Redis for cache/service scenarios and RabbitMQ for async workflows.
- Extract functionality from a monolith into services with clear boundaries and ownership.
- Improve delivery quality through tests, API regression coverage for critical scenarios, code reviews, and PR standards.
- Develop GitLab CI/CD pipelines with quality and security checks (SonarQube, cargo audit).
- Support production operations: incident analysis, fixes, and preventive improvements.
- Improve observability with Grafana dashboards/metrics and Sentry errors/events.

**Achievements:**
- Released and sustainably maintained stable production Rust components and services.
- Stabilized API and integration flows via contract-first development and backward compatibility.
- Improved release quality through tests, review discipline, and CI quality gates.
- Reduced time to root-cause analysis and made operational fixes more systematic.
- Lowered release risk by enforcing disciplined change procedures.

**Stack:** Rust, Actix Web, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Docker, GitLab CI/CD, GitOps, Grafana, Sentry, Swagger/OpenAPI, SonarQube, cargo audit.

### Lead Rust Engineer • [YADRO](https://yadro.com/)
*February 2022 — March 2023*

Software-hardware backup system with data deduplication.

- Led delivery of key components and architecture decisions for storage and restore subsystems.
- Introduced team engineering practices: planning, code review, quality standards, CI/CD, and automated testing.
- Mentored engineers and supported C++ → Rust migration through training and internal guides.
- Improved performance and reliability: tuned RocksDB and storage layers, ran load tests, analyzed incidents, fixed root causes.
- Increased operational readiness through metrics, alerting, documentation, and runbooks.

**Stack:** Rust, RocksDB, CI/CD, load testing, metrics, alerting.

### Software Engineer • [Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com/)
*May 2020 — May 2022*

- Developed and maintained a production service, prioritizing changes from user feedback.
- Implemented weighted voting and optimized voting and ballot-processing flows.
- Increased unit + integration test coverage by 75%, reducing regression risk.
- Simplified pipelines and delivery during migration to Microsoft tooling.
- Refactored and maintained components to keep production stability.

**Stack:** Rust, Exonum, Protobuf, Serde, Git.

### Software Engineer • [B2Broker](https://b2broker.com/)
*November 2018 — March 2020*

- Built automation and integration components for MT4/MT5 APIs, supporting production stability.
- Delivered trade copiers in C++ and Go and Multi Account Manager functionality.
- Designed services for normalization and streaming delivery of trading data with strict latency and integrity requirements.
- Built data collectors and analytics/monitoring loops for quality control.
- Aligned protocols and API contracts with adjacent teams.

**Stack:** C++, Go, MSVC, CMake, Protobuf, gRPC, NATS, YAML, PostgreSQL, vcpkg, Git.

### C++ Lead Engineer • [ASCON](https://ascon.ru)
*May 2016 — November 2018*

- Developed CAD library components and KOMPAS-3D features (including Change View Plane).
- Introduced an automated testing pipeline (C++ + Python), reducing manual QA effort.
- Migrated the project to C++17 and established engineering standards and team practices.
- Led SVN → Git migration and established code review and build processes.
- Ran regular planning, retrospectives, and documentation standards for predictable delivery.

**Stack:** C++17, MSVC, Python 3, Boost, PostgreSQL, Git, Jenkins.

### Earlier Experience • Programmer
*September 2012 — May 2016*

- **Concerteza:** C++; telecom protocol parsing for signaling analytics; CPU/memory optimization; stable processing of continuous streams up to 1.5 Gbps in a single thread; Python integration tests.
- **LiveTex:** C++ and JavaScript; Node.js bindings for PostgreSQL; ZeroMQ integrations.
- **T4B:** C++; plugins/modules for MetaTrader; management web app.
