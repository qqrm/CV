# Task: Document adding new locales

## Description
Provide clear instructions for contributors on how to introduce a new language variant to the CV system. Role-based variants were deprecated, so the focus is solely on additional locales.

## Steps
- Outline required files and configuration for a new locale.
- Describe commands for generating PDFs and site pages.
- Include examples for both English and Russian setups.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Documentation explains how to add a locale and compile outputs.
- Examples compile successfully using the documented commands.
- `cargo test` and Typst builds pass.
