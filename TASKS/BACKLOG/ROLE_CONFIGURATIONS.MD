# Task: (Deprecated) Add role-based CV configurations

## Description
This task captured an earlier idea to generate tailored CV versions for different positions. The repository has since dropped role-specific variants, so this backlog item should be closed or repurposed toward locale-only improvements.

## Steps
- Evaluate whether any locale-specific configuration is still necessary.
- Update documentation to clarify that role variants are no longer supported.
- Remove or archive legacy role-related assets if any remain.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Documentation and backlog reflect the locale-only scope.
- `cargo test` and Typst builds pass.
