# Task: Analyze Static Site Build Pipeline

## Description
The GitHub Pages site sometimes serves outdated content. After removing LaTeX files from the repository they still appear on the deployed site.
Investigate the existing build pipeline and update it so that generated pages are always consistent with the repository contents.
