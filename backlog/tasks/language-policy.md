# Task: Clarify documentation language policy

## Description
The `AGENTS.md` states that all documentation is maintained in English, but the repository contains Russian files such as `README_ru.md`, `cv.ru.md` and `docs/ru/`. Update the guidelines to explicitly mention allowed localized documents or translate remaining Russian files to English.

## Acceptance criteria
