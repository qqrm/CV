# Documentation Guidelines

- All documentation is written in English.
- File names for Markdown (`.md`) and Mermaid (`.mmd`) documents must use **uppercase** letters.
  This avoids cross-platform case-sensitivity issues.
- Public URLs should include a trailing slash (e.g., `/tl/ru/`). The version without the slash
  redirects to the canonical form.
