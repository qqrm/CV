# Resume Layout Checklist

## Format
- Export a single-page English PDF as the primary artifact.
- Keep margins at 1 inch, body text at 11-12 pt, and section headers at 14-16 pt.
- Avoid tables and graphics. Use Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, Georgia, or Garamond.

## Content Rules
- Write every bullet with STAR structure plus metrics: action, scope, metric, business outcome. Keep bullets to one line.
- Balance people and technical leadership in skills and experience sections. Call out headcount, budget, vendors, SLAs, SLOs, MTTR, and CFR.
- Compress roles prior to 2018 into one or two lines. Focus on the most recent five to seven years.

## Online
- Surface header buttons on the website: Download EN PDF, View RU, GitHub, LinkedIn.
- Reuse this About section on LinkedIn and mirror the same impact bullets in each role description.
